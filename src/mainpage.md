ViraquchaUML {#mainpage}
================================================================================

Introduction
------------

ViraquchaUML is an open source modelling tool for software architects as well as
software engineers based on the Unified Modelling Language 2.5.1. It is entirely 
written in C++ using the open source library Qt and should therefore work on all 
major operating systems supported by Qt (Android/Linux, MacOS and Windows).

ViraquchaUML uses JSON files for serialization of UML data instead of a database 
system. This has the advantage that ViraquchaUML projects can be compared or 
merged by version control systems, but the disadvantage that UML projects 
(currently) cannot be modified by multiple users.
